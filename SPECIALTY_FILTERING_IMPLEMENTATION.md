# Specialty Routing - Enhanced Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task 9: "Integrate with existing case filtering and search functionality" for the specialty routing system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SpecialtyCasePage Component

- **File**: `src/pages/SpecialtyCasePage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive filtering state management with `CaseFilters` interface
  - Implemented pagination support with `CasesResponse` interface
  - Added advanced filtering options (patient age range, gender)
  - Enhanced search functionality with filter persistence
  - Added pagination controls with page size selection
  - Improved case count displays with filter-aware messaging
  - Added active filters summary display

### 2. Enhanced API Service

- **File**: `src/services/apiService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getCases` method to handle additional filter parameters
  - Added proper pagination response handling
  - Improved parameter sanitization to avoid sending empty values
  - Enhanced response structure with pagination metadata

### 3. Specialty Context Preservation

- **Files**:
  - `src/pages/SpecialtyCasePage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/SimulationChatPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/SimulationPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced simulation start to preserve specialty context in navigation state
  - Updated simulation chat page to use specialty context for return navigation
  - Added specialty-aware return URLs for better user experience

### 4. Testing

- **File**: `src/pages/SpecialtyCasePage.test.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Created comprehensive test suite for enhanced filtering functionality
  - Added tests for pagination, search, advanced filters, and specialty context preservation
  - Verified API integration and state management

## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Filtering

- **Search**: Text-based search within specialty cases
- **Patient Gender**: Filter by Male/Female
- **Age Range**: Filter by minimum and maximum patient age
- **Pagination**: Configurable page size (6, 12, 24, 48 cases per page)

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Filter Persistence**: Filters are maintained during navigation and interactions
- **Active Filter Display**: Visual summary of currently applied filters
- **Smart Case Counts**: Context-aware case count displays
- **Pagination Info**: Clear indication of current page and total results

### Specialty Context Preservation

- **Simulation Navigation**: Specialty context is preserved when starting simulations
- **Return Navigation**: Users return to the correct specialty page after simulations
- **Context Awareness**: All filtering operations maintain specialty scope

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **5.1**: Existing search, pagination, and filtering work within specialty context
✅ **5.2**: Specialty filter is maintained when applying additional case filters  
✅ **5.4**: Case count displays reflect specialty-specific totals
✅ **5.4**: Specialty context is preserved during case interactions and simulation starts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Filter State Management

```typescript
interface CaseFilters {
  search: string;
  patient_age_min?: number;
  patient_age_max?: number;
  patient_gender?: string;
  page: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

### Pagination Response

```typescript
interface CasesResponse {
  cases: Case[];
  currentPage: number;
  totalPages: number;
  totalCases: number;
  hasNextPage: boolean;
  hasPrevPage: boolean;
}
```

### Specialty Context Navigation

```typescript
// Preserved in navigation state when starting simulations
navigate(`/simulation/${case_.id}/session/${response.sessionId}`, {
  state: {
    specialtyContext: {
      specialty: specialtyName,
      specialtySlug: specialtySlug,
      returnUrl: `/${specialtySlug}`,
    },
  },
});
```

## Testing Coverage

- ✅ Filter UI rendering and interaction
- ✅ API integration with filter parameters
- ✅ Pagination controls and navigation
- ✅ Active filter display and clearing
- ✅ Specialty context preservation during simulations
- ✅ Case count accuracy with filters applied

## Performance Considerations

- Filters trigger API calls with debounced effect
- Pagination reduces initial load time
- Filter state is efficiently managed with React hooks
- API parameters are sanitized to avoid unnecessary requests
