ðŸŽ¨ FAVICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

You now have several SVG favicon options in your public folder:
1. favicon.svg (Stethoscope - RECOMMENDED)
2. favicon-cross.svg (Medical Cross with S)
3. favicon-heart.svg (Heart with Pulse)
4. favicon-brain.svg (Brain for Learning)

To complete the favicon setup, you need to:

1. Choose your preferred SVG design (I recommend the stethoscope)
2. Rename your chosen design to 'favicon.svg' if it's not already
3. Generate PNG versions using an online tool or image editor:

REQUIRED SIZES:
- favicon-16x16.png (16x16 pixels)
- favicon-32x32.png (32x32 pixels)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)
- android-chrome-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- android-chrome-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

RECOMMENDED ONLINE TOOLS:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/ (Upload your SVG and get all sizes)
- https://favicon.io/ (Simple favicon generator)
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/ (Another good option)

STEPS:
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your chosen SVG file
3. Download the generated favicon package
4. Extract and place all files in your public folder
5. The HTML is already updated with the correct references!

ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT RECOMMENDATION: Use the stethoscope design (favicon.svg)
It's professional, instantly recognizable as medical, and works well at small sizes.
